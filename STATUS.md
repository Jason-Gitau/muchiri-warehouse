## 📝 Notes for Next Developer

### If I (Claude) Get Interrupted:

**Read This First:**
1. Open `DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md` - it tells you exactly what to do next
2. Check the "⏳ In Progress" section above
3. Run the "Next Command to Run" shown above
4. Follow MVP_PLAN.md step by step

### Quick Context:
- We just finished planning and documentation
- About to start coding the actual MVP
- Next step is literally just running `create-next-app`
- All the code examples you need are in MVP_PLAN.md

### Time Estimate:
- You're about 30 minutes away from having a working Next.js app
- About 2 hours from having auth working
- About 6 hours from having products working
- About 19 hours total to complete MVP

**Don't overthink it - just follow MVP_PLAN.md milestone by milestone! 🚀**
